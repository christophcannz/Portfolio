            Hello, My name is Christopher Cannady. I am a web developer and graphic designer based <br>
            out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. My lifelong passion for design and layout has led me to constantly<br>
            find ways to allow my creativity to come to life in a professional manner. It all started in grade school<br>
            where my sheets of homework would oftentimes be overcome by sketches of basketball logos.<br>
            This may have made grading difficult for my teachers, however it was what led me to get my 
            <br>Bachelor of Science Degree in Graphic Design from The Art Institutes International Minnesota.<br>
            From there, I begin to toy around with web design using Yahoo! GeoCities and Adobe Dreamweaver<br> 
            which eventually led me to seek a deeper knowledge in the subject matter. Most recently, I received my<br>
            Full-Stack Web Developer Certificate from the University of Minnesota College of Continuing & Professional Studies.<br>
            Please take a moment to view my portfolio content and feel free to contact me. Thank you.
