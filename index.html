        <p>
            I am a web developer and graphic designer based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. My lifelong enthusiasm<br>
            for design and layout has led me to constantly find ways to allow my creativity to come to life in a<br>
            professional manner. It all started in grade school where my sheets of homework would oftentimes be<br>
            overcome by sketches of basketball logos. This may have made grading difficult for my teachers, however<br>
            it was what led me to get my Bachelor of Science Degree in Graphic Design from the Art Institutes International<br>
            Minnesota. From there, I begin to toy around with web design using Yahoo! GeoCities which eventually led me<br>
            to seek a deeper knowledge of how websites are engineered. Most recently, I received my Full Stack Web Developer<br>
            Certificate from the University of Minnesota College of Continuing & Professional Studies. Thank you for Visiting!
